# GitHub Actions Workflow: Build Ziyatron EEG Annotator
# =============================================================================
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
#   Builds standalone executables (.exe for Windows, app for macOS) so
#   neurologists can run the app without installing Python.
#
# HOW IT WORKS:
#   1. GitHub spins up virtual machines (one Windows, one macOS)
#   2. Installs Python and your dependencies on each
#   3. Runs PyInstaller to create a standalone executable
#   4. Packages it into a ZIP file
#   5. If this was triggered by a version tag (e.g., v2.0.1), creates a
#      Release page on GitHub with both ZIPs ready for download
#
# HOW TO USE:
#   - Push any commit to main or open a PR  → builds run (no release created)
#   - Click "Run workflow" in Actions tab   → builds run (no release created)
#   - Push a version tag                    → builds run AND release is created
#       git tag v2.0.1
#       git push origin v2.0.1
#

# --- TRIGGERS ---
# "on" defines WHEN this workflow runs.
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'v*'  # Runs when you push a tag starting with "v" (e.g., v2.0.0, v2.1.0)
  workflow_dispatch:  # Adds a "Run workflow" button in the GitHub Actions tab
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]  # Runs when a PR targets the main branch

# =============================================================================
# JOB 1: BUILD
# =============================================================================
# Builds the app on Windows and macOS in parallel.
# Each OS gets its own virtual machine (called a "runner").
# =============================================================================
jobs:
  build:
    # "strategy.matrix" runs this job multiple times with different settings.
    # Here it runs twice: once on Windows, once on macOS — in parallel.
    strategy:
      fail-fast: false  # If one OS fails, still try the other
      matrix:
        os: [windows-latest, macos-latest]

    # "runs-on" picks the virtual machine. ${{ matrix.os }} gets replaced
    # with "windows-latest" or "macos-latest" from the matrix above.
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}

    steps:
      # --- Step 1: Get the code ---
      # Downloads your repository onto the virtual machine.
      # Without this, the runner has an empty filesystem.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # --- Step 2: Install Python ---
      # GitHub runners have Python pre-installed, but we want a specific version.
      # cache: 'pip' saves downloaded packages between runs so future builds
      # don't re-download everything (saves 1-2 minutes).
      - name: Set up Python 3.10
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.10'
          cache: 'pip'

      # --- Step 3: Install dependencies ---
      # Same as running "pip install -r requirements.txt" on your own machine.
      # This installs mne, PyQt6, pyqtgraph, pyinstaller, and everything else.
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # --- Step 4: Build the executable ---
      # PyInstaller reads main.spec (your build config) and creates a standalone
      # executable in the dist/eeg_annotator/ folder. The spec file already
      # handles all optimizations (excluding matplotlib, unused Qt modules, etc.)
      # This step takes 5-15 minutes.
      - name: Build with PyInstaller
        run: pyinstaller main.spec

      # --- Step 5: Show build size in the logs ---
      # This prints the total bundle size so you can monitor for bloat.
      # Target: under 200MB. If it grows past that, check what's being included.
      - name: Log build size (macOS)
        if: runner.os != 'Windows'
        run: |
          echo "=== Build output ==="
          ls -lah dist/
          echo "=== App bundle size ==="
          du -sh dist/eeg_annotator.app/

      # Confirms PyInstaller applied ad-hoc signatures to the .app bundle.
      # Ad-hoc signing (identity "-") is free, requires no Apple Developer account,
      # and satisfies macOS SIP on both Intel and Apple Silicon.
      # Users will still see a Gatekeeper warning on first launch — right-click → Open bypasses it.
      - name: Verify ad-hoc signing (macOS)
        if: runner.os != 'Windows'
        run: |
          codesign --verify --verbose dist/eeg_annotator.app || echo "Warning: signing check failed"
          codesign -dvvv dist/eeg_annotator.app 2>&1 | grep -E "Authority|TeamIdentifier|Signature|Format"

      - name: Log build size (Windows)
        if: runner.os == 'Windows'
        run: |
          echo "=== Build output ==="
          dir dist\
          echo "=== Total bundle size ==="
          powershell -c "'{0:N2} MB' -f ((Get-ChildItem dist\eeg_annotator -Recurse | Measure-Object -Property Length -Sum).Sum / 1MB)"

      # --- Step 6: Create a ZIP file ---
      # Packages the entire dist/eeg_annotator/ folder into a single ZIP.
      # Named "eeg_annotator-macOS.zip" or "eeg_annotator-Windows.zip".
      # Use ditto instead of zip — it preserves symlinks inside Qt .framework bundles.
      # Plain zip -r breaks those symlinks, causing the app to crash on launch.
      # --sequesterRsrc preserves macOS resource forks; --keepParent includes the .app name in the archive.
      - name: Create ZIP archive (macOS)
        if: runner.os != 'Windows'
        run: |
          ditto -c -k --sequesterRsrc --keepParent \
            dist/eeg_annotator.app \
            eeg_annotator-${{ runner.os }}.zip

      - name: Create ZIP archive (Windows)
        if: runner.os == 'Windows'
        run: |
          cd dist
          powershell Compress-Archive -Path eeg_annotator -DestinationPath ../eeg_annotator-${{ runner.os }}.zip

      # --- Step 7: Upload the ZIP as an artifact ---
      # "Artifacts" are files stored by GitHub for 30 days. You can download
      # them from the Actions tab even without creating a release.
      # The release job (below) also downloads these to attach to the release.
      - name: Upload build artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: eeg_annotator-${{ runner.os }}
          path: eeg_annotator-${{ runner.os }}.zip
          retention-days: 30

  # ===========================================================================
  # JOB 2: RELEASE
  # ===========================================================================
  # Creates a GitHub Release with both ZIP files attached.
  # Only runs when you push a version tag (e.g., v2.0.1).
  # Waits for BOTH Windows and macOS builds to finish before running.
  #
  # Why a separate job? If both build jobs tried to create the release
  # simultaneously, they'd conflict. This job runs once after both finish.
  # ===========================================================================
  release:
    needs: build  # Waits for the build job to finish on ALL matrix entries
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Lightweight Linux runner (just creating a release)

    steps:
      # --- Step 1: Download the ZIPs from both builds ---

        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          path: artifacts

      # --- Step 2: Show what was downloaded (for debugging) ---
      - name: List downloaded artifacts
        run: find artifacts -type f -name "*.zip"

      # --- Step 3: Create the GitHub Release ---
      # This creates a Release page (like github.com/you/repo/releases)
      # with both ZIPs attached for download.
      #
      # generate_release_notes: true makes GitHub auto-create a changelog
      # from all commits since the previous tag. No hardcoded notes needed!
      #
      # The "body" field adds a download table and install instructions
      # above the auto-generated changelog.

            ### Downloads
            | Platform | File |
            |----------|------|
            | Windows | `eeg_annotator-Windows.zip` |
            | macOS | `eeg_annotator-macOS.zip` |

            ### Installation
            1. Download the ZIP file for your platform
            2. Extract the archive
            3. Run the `eeg_annotator` executable
            4. **macOS users**: Unzip, then right-click `eeg_annotator.app` → **Open** (first launch only, to bypass Gatekeeper). Move to Applications folder if desired.
